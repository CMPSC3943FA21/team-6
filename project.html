          <p>It is normal to be scared, distressed or angry when you hear about a disease outbreak, even when you are at a low risk of getting sick. Be careful not to turn fear and anger towards people who may become sick or healthcare workers</p>

          <p class="historyHeadp"> "According to the CDC, most cases of COVID-19 spread through close contact, via contact transmission or droplet transmission," says Dr. Thinh Xuan Ho, family medicine physician at Baylor St. Lukeâ€™s Medical Group in Tomball.

In the case of contact transmission, there is a risk of contracting the virus by physical contact such as a handshake. Avoiding this kind of contact with people, especially those not in your household, is a good idea.  </p>
